Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language having N words and k starting alphabets of standard dictionary. Find the order of characters in the alien language.(AlienDictionary.java)

2)Remove Loop from Linked list(14/09/2021):
Given a linked list of N nodes such that it may contain a loop. Remove the loop from the linked list, if it is present.(RemoveLoopInLinkedList.java)

3)Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s(15/09/2021):
Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.(SortArray.java)

4)N meetings in one room(16/09/2021):
There is one meeting room in a firm. There are N meetings in the form of (start[i], end[i]) where start[i] is start time of meeting i and end[i] is finish time of meeting i.
What is the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room when only one meeting can be held in the meeting room at a particular time?(NMeetingsInOneRoom.java)

5)Kth element of 2 sorted arrays(17/09/2021):
Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that wo/uld be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.(/KthElementOfTwoSortedArrays.java)

6)palindromic partitioning of a string(17/09/2021):
Given a String S, Find all possible Palindromic partitions of the given String.(PalindromicPartitioningOfAString.java)

7)Dam of candies(21/09/2021):
Geek wants to make a special space for candies on his bookshelf. Currently, it has N books of different heights, represented by the array height[] and unit width. Help him select 2 books such that he can store maximum candies between them by removing all the other books from between the selected books. The task is to find out the area between two books that can hold the maximum candies without changing the original position of selected books. (DamOfCandies.java)

8)Repeated String Match(22/09/2021):
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B becomes a substring of the repeated A. If B cannot be a substring of A no matter how many times it is repeated, return -1.(RepeatedStringMatch.java)

9)Count total set bits(23/09/2021):
You are given a number N. Find the total count of set bits for all numbers from 1 to N(both inclusive). (CountTotalSetBits.java)

10)Largest subarray with 0 sum(25/09/2021):
Given an array having both positive and negative integers. The task is to compute the length of the largest subarray with sum 0.(LargestSubarrayWithZeroSum.java)

11)Middle element in a liked list(27/09/2021):
Given a singly linked list of N nodes. The task is to find the middle of the linked list.1-> 2->3->4->5, then the middle node of the list is 3. If there are two middle nodes(in case, when N is even), print the second middle element. For example, if the linked list given is 1->2->3->4->5->6, then the middle node of the list is 4.(MiddleElementInALinkedList.java)

12)LargestIndependentSetProblem (27/09/2021):
Given a Binary Tree of size N, find the size of the Largest Independent Set(LIS) in it. A subset of all tree nodes is an independent set if there is no edge between any two nodes of the subset. Your task is to complete the function LISS(), which finds the size of the Largest Independent Set.(LargestIndependentSetProblem.java)

13)Count triplets with sum smaller than X (12/10/2021):
Given an array arr[] of distinct integers of size N and a value sum, the task is to find the count of triplets (i, j, k), having (i<j<k) with the sum of (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) smaller than the given value sum.(TripletsWithSmallerSum.java)

14)Interleaved Strings (13/10/2021):
Given strings A, B, and C, find whether C is formed by an interleaving of A and B.
An interleaving of two strings S and T is a configuration such that it creates a new string Y from the concatenation substrings of A and B and |Y| = |A + B| = |C| (InterleavedStrings.java)
